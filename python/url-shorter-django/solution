Implement the exercise using Django and avoid additional dependencies

I'm not familiar with Django so I guess settings.py contain some redundants import or variable.


Pay attention
to how you generate the short URL. What can go wrong? How do you plan to handle it

I saw there is many tutorials on how to crate short URL.
I do validate with API call for the URL to check that available and correct.and then I init object with increment key that will be is unique short url. 

Include unit tests 
I'm added test to check if hit the counter work well. 

Include meaningful comments 
I don't find a place for a comment cause it's really small code and in all the error messages
there is a detail of what I try to accomplish and why it's fall.
