# OOP_Polynom

MyMath OOP Project 

In this project we present Monom and Polynom 
we using three class of interface it call function and Polynomial and cont_function 
we have also implement Comparator class its call Monom_Comperator 
and two class to implements the function it's call Monom and Polynom. 
to store all the Monom I decided to use Hashmap.  
cause it's prevent duplicate and while I search for some Monom it's with 
the best complexity. 
 
We have also Test unit to check all our Function is working well. 
 
If you want to try it you can create Polynom 
 But make sure when you write it you write it legal cause if not the program 
Will throw exception. 
Example for a good one is like :"7*x^3 + 5*x^2 + 2*x^4". 
And then you can check it out with the function for example like 
Multiply divertive, equals copy ,etc.
